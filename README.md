## NHANH.VN API SDK FOR JAVASCRIPT

---

This SDK aims to make using Nhanh.vn API from NodeJS better.

Nhanh.vn only provides PHP client so I have to write this.

---

## Documentation

- All apis are (eventually) the same as seen on https://developers.nhanh.vn/

- These is a direct api call function if you need something I've not created.

- There are difference between actual api call result and the document, because the document is outdated, if you find an inconsistency I will update it (to match the api, not the document).

- This project is created with typescript, so I think you will able to use it with ease.

## Contribution

All contribution are welcomed. But I think only Vietnamese developers are interested in this.

Open an issue if you need some functions or create a PR if you want to help this project.
